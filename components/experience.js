            <h3>Final thesis on open source</h3>
            <h5>2020 - 2021</h5>
            <p>In my final degree project I collaborated with an open source repository (
              <a href="https://github.com/coopdevs/TimeOverflow">TimeOverflow</a>) where I worked with Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. 
              I was lucky enough to have a code reviewer from whom I was able to get a lot of feedback. 
              This along with working with well-formed code helped me to get a good idea of the framework. </p>
